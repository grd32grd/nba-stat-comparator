# nba-stat-comparator
Python program that utilizes a tkinter GUI, pandas dataframes, & matplotlib graphics to graph statistical comparisons between two NBA players and visualizes them in a way that's easy to interpret. Useful for obtaining NBA player data.

# Purpose
As a big basketball and NBA player, I've always found myself researching data in order to compare players when debating with friends & others. 
I decided it would be a cool idea to come up with this program so I can do so in a easy and convenient way.

# Personal To-Do List
Implement GUI that'll allow user to input players
Swap the order of the two players depending on who entered the league first (debugging)
